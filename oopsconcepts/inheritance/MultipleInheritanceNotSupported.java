	 MULTIPLE INHERITANCE NOT SUPPORTED IN JAVA
	 ie 
	 
	 ONE CHILD CLASS CANNOT INHERIT 2 PARENT CLASSES
	 

     WHY IT IS NOT ALLLOWED??
     
     Suppose class C has 2 Parent Classes A and B , both A and B show() method
     now if C class calls show() method we donot know if A method will be called 
     or B called
	 This problem is called ambiguity ie we have confusion which parent class method
	 to choose
